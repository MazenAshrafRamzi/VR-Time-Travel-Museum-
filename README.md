## 🏛️ Roman Pavilion Experience

The Roman pavilion was designed to feel like an elevated, heavenly vision of Rome, combining  
historical inspiration with VR interactivity.

### ✨ Features
- **Photogrammetry Statues**:  
  Two statues, the *Funerary Lion* and the *Praying Boy*, were generated from real statues in Berlin  
  using video capture and reconstructed via *RealityCapture* and *Luma AI Fields*.
- **3D Assets**:  
  Additional Roman statues, antiques, and props were sourced from public online resources.  
  The Colosseum and a Roman NPC were generated with *Meshy.ai*.
- **NPC & Animation**:  
  The NPC was rigged and animated using *Mixamo* to deliver a lifelike interaction.  
  The NPC voice lines were generated using AI online audio generation websites such as *Toolsaday Dialogue Generator*.


- **Interactive Storytelling**:  
  - Users view each statue with floating UI panels containing historical context generated from AI.  
  - After climbing the stairs to the Colosseum, users meet the NPC soldier.  
  - The NPC shares insights as a Roman gladiator who fought in the Colosseum death battles and then challenges the user with a riddle:  
    *“I came to Rome when it was a city of bricks and left it a city of …”*  
    - Correct answer: **marble**  
    - The user confirms by picking up a marble material and moving it on top of the small pillar infront of it.  
  - A final statue of Emperor Augustus appears at the start area, symbolizing his vision of Rome.  
  - A portal opens, returning users to the central museum hub.
